<h2> Linear Regression </h2>
  
To understand the working functionality of this algorithm, imagine how you would arrange random logs of wood in increasing order of their weight. There is a catch; however â€“ you cannot weigh each log. You have to guess its weight just by looking at the height and girth of the log (visual analysis) and arrange them using a combination of these visible parameters. This is what linear regression in machine learning is like.

Simply, Linear Regression's algorithm is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another variable. 

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.

Hope you guys understand what is linear regression. Make sure you know intuition behind linear regression before you go for the practical implementation.

 Hope the intuition behind linear regression is quite clear to you , access the jupyter notebook for its practical implementation.
